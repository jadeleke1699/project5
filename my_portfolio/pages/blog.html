	  <p><span style="font-family: madre-script, 'sans-serif;'">Writing is a craft that </span>I genuinely enjoy. I like writing because it allows me to write characters like myself and learn more about myself. It also allows me to be more empathetic. It's a comforting for me and it allows me to express myself. It's also very interesting for me to write from other people's perspectives and consider what makes them tick. What from their past affects them, what moves them, and what makes them who they are.</p>

		<h1>Excerpt #1</h1>
		<img src="../images/song.jpg" alt="sunflower" width="250" height="171" class="floatleft"/> <p><span style="font-family: madre-script, 'sans-serif;'">I picked up my phone,</span>
		opened a recording app, and pressed play. A melody that I&rsquo;d sung softly at two am in my room traveled up my earbuds and flooded my ears. I closed my eyes. Listened. Singing at two am… it&rsquo;s a different kind of feeling. At that point you&rsquo;re so sleep-deprived you&rsquo;ve entered another realm—your body is present, your spirit is not. You&rsquo;re waist deep in the ocean of dreams, only a few steps away from the shore of consciousness.</p>
		<p dir="ltr">For me, though, staying on the shore is my only way of escaping the raging waves.</p>
		<p dir="ltr">My grip tightened on my stylus. But I let myself breathe for a moment, and replayed my two am melody. This time, I felt the words that had built up inside of me let them free.</p>

		<h1>Excerpt #2</h1>
		<img src="../images/arena.jpg" width="250" height="160" alt="sunflower"/> <p><span style="font-family: madre-script, 'sans-serif;'">Valorie stood in the shaded balcony</span>
		of the Arena, face flushed as she wrung her hands.&nbsp;</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Cicero stood in the center of the arena, enveloped in the roar of the people as the maiden approached him. The sand beneath their feet must have been hot as coals in the afternoon sun. The circular arena, made mostly of beige stone, had rows upon rows of marble seats overflowing with onlookers screaming and cheering.</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Valorie&rsquo;s father sat on his throne behind her, next to the smaller throne she should be sitting on. She didn&rsquo;t have to turn around to know he was drinking champagne—he always did during the Arena. Servants were pouring it for him, and he was laughing, chatting with one of his favorite pretty maids.&nbsp;</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Valorie bit her lip. Cicero had followed her instructions. Everything was going according to plan. Still, every fiber in her body wanted to scream, to lash out, to destroy every person in this arena but him.</p>
		<p dir="ltr">But no. In all due time. For now, she had to be calm—precise.</p>
